                        <p>Life is not full without productivity, right? Getting back on topic, I have various assignments and projects that I have done while at CART, as well as having various side projects down the line for my hobbies and interests. And let’s be honest, you will never know where you will be if you don’t do your work. I mean, think about it, what would you do if you’ve already graduated high school? Would you sit around and do nothing but play video games all day? Or would you seek out in college and get your bachelor’s degree in various fields? <br><br>Questions aside, I did have assignments and projects during CART, with the english stuff usually happening first in class and then the web programming coming in second (throughout the whole of the first semester of CART).<br><br>If you would like to see my assignments and/or projects that I had in CART, as well as my hobbies and interests, click on one of the buttons below.</p>
