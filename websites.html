                        <p>One of the very first websites that I have created during CART, this was an assignment given to me at the very beginning of my senior year in 2019. This was an exercise in JavaScript learning as I had to basically learn its data types, functions, workflows, and had to do some extensive debugging on getting the code to work as intended. The JavaScript code was originally done on Repl.it before moving it over to the main HTML page, making various modifications to compensate the change from solely being a program written specifically for the console debugger into a full web-based interface where anyone can make calculations by entering in a “calculator type” and then entering in the two digits separately and brings out the outcome of that calculation.<br><br>This program can perform simple math calculator functions, such as adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing. The website also has a simplified, but useful design thanks to the small amount of CSS code.</p>

                        <h3>Interactive Story</h3>
                        <p>One of my most favorite projects that I did at CART, this project was part of the “Choose your own adventure” games where every decision the user makes can effectively make or break the plot of the story. During development, it tried to stay closely to the “12 steps of a hero’s journey” in which it had three beginnings and endings. Planning was heavily involved with the development of the interactive story, as my team had to make a flowchart detailing about the flow of each part of the story. Then it was down to coding the main website, where everything should be properly formatted, have each story as an array, etc.<br><br>The main show of the interactive story is about the overall setting and plot of the website. The Orange Cat, my original character that I have created back in 11th grade, is the main protagonist of the story, with the Black Cat Group, a brand-new set of characters made specifically for this story, as antagonists. The overall plot of the interactive story comes from the short story assignment that I did during my English class at CART. Originally, I had the idea of my original character, The Orange Cat, being trapped inside a Windows 3D Maze screensaver and attempts to escape it (the setting of that story is set in the late-1990’s if you want to know), but I’ve scrapped it in favor of the story with The Orange Cat and the Black Cat Group due to it not following the “12 steps of a hero’s journey” and possibly for it not being based on my short story assignment, since the plotline for that idea was completely new.<br><br>However, the scrapped idea of having The Orange Cat trapped inside a Windows screensaver was soon brought over to fruition as a side-project after the interactive story featuring The Orange Cat and the Black Cat Group was finished.</p>

                        <h3>Chess Project</h3>
                        <p>This is the project that I have done as part of the digital board game project. For that project, each team will have to make a new board game based on existing rules of the game and begin to make modifications to the rules of the game (such as adding a twist to the original game). For this project, I have decided a standard game of chess but including a dice mechanic into the game (which at the moment, is limited to only determining who goes first to play chess). For the board itself, I had it made in a HTML5 Canvas element, with the movable pieces aligning on to the board. Originally, I was going to have a Monopoly-like game with my original character, The Orange Cat, into the mix along with other planned rule changes, but did not come into fruition as I thought it would be hard to implement a Monopoly board game mechanic due to my then-limited knowledge of knowing how to program a Monopoly-like game in a website.<br><br>This project was then shown at the showcase event that happened in January 2020 at CART. Due to time-constraints, I was unable to get the board pieces to function correctly, but at least I am happy with the end result that I’ve had.</p>

                        <h3>The Zen Garden</h3>
                        <p>The CSS Zen Garden is an assignment that relates to various features of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), such as a flexbox layout, a rows-and-columns layout, and other features of CSS in of itself to make it look more appealing. For this assignment, I had to create the CSS file from scratch, and had to correctly point to the divs and ids from the HTML file without changing anything on the main HTML file. I have chosen a green theme for my styling of the website, having a static green lava lamp background and an overall green theme to it on the website.<br><br>Overall, this assignment was fun to do, given the fact that it kind of lets me experiment with CSS a little more often, and also making it look good and appealing, and also unique in any other way.</p>
