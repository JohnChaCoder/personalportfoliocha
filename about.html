                        <h3>About Myself</h3>
                        <p>Hello! My name is Johnny Cha. I am a senior at Clovis East High School and also attended The Center for Advanced Research and Technology (CART) during my senior year.<br><br>I’m describing myself as a "tech-savvy" person that has the basic “know-how” of how these electronic devices worked due to the vast amount of knowledge that I had in mind with these computing devices, and I’m also a “talented artist” when it comes to my drawings that I do in my spare time.<br><br>When I started doing computer classes way back in seventh grade, I have achieved basic knowledge of programming, writing, and coding through various computer-related projects at my middle and high schools, and had applied to CART for a Web Applications Development class, where I was able to take my knowledge a bit further by entering the world of programming and coding with <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, and JavaScript, the three “main” parts of each and every website on the World Wide Web. In that class, I have tried my best to put in the best effort that I can to my advantage, without being distracted or side-tracked by other things. I also have to make almost everything from scratch, starting from the more simple calculator project that I had to the more intermediate and complex flexboxes and Zen Garden assignments that I had later on in the year.</p>

                    <h3>My Achievements & Awards</h3>
                    <p>I have various achievements and awards sent out for me in the past, most of them in elementary school. I had a perfect attendance award around 2nd grade when in that time I have never missed any day at school, and I’ve also had an award for reading a couple of times during 1st grade at Temperance Kutner Elementary (from what I’ve remember currently). I don’t recall getting any more achievements and/or awards after that period of time, but I’ve kind of remembered getting my grade-school graduation certificate during 6th grade at that time.</p>
