                        <h3>Video Gaming</h3>
                        <p>For the longest time, I’ve had a very strong interest in video games of any era, from the early cartridge-based consoles to the more modern disc-based and online-gaming consoles. I have owned and played a couple of them in my lifetime, starting with the PlayStation 2, one of my favorite and nostalgic video game consoles of all time. The PlayStation 2 is also the best-selling game console of all time, selling over 155 million units before its discontinuation in early 2013. My family owned both the original “fat” and slim models over time before selling them off in 2013, until my 17th birthday when I’ve received two original PS2 systems thanks to nostalgia. I’ve even owned a PlayStation 3 (slim model) and had that until 2013 (but had another one and had that ever since), and an XBOX 360 (slim model) before selling that in 2013 (and then had another and playing it ever since), and most recently, a Nintendo Switch that I had for Christmas of 2019.<br><br>In the latter part of the 2010’s, I have gotten and received nostalgia for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, Sega’s 16-bit console from the late-1980’s to the mid-to-late-1990’s, and got a dedicated miniature version of the console known as the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis Mini, which came preloaded with 40 games (plus two bonus games). I will be planning to get an original model of the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis very soon when the time comes.</p>

                        <p>In the late-2000’s, I had experimented with video production, making home movies and videos using Windows Movie Maker, Microsoft’s simple but elegant video-editing software for its Windows operating systems. Specifically, around that time, I’ve used Windows Vista’s version of Movie Maker, and had been using it until around 2014 when I’ve started to use NCH Software’s VideoPad Video Editor (the non-commercial free version) and had been using that program ever since for various small video-related projects and other things.</p>

                        <h3>Drawings & Arts</h3>
                        <p>I have been drawing for a long time. Back when I was little, I used to draw so many random things that it seems to portray something that was in my mind when I was drawing those things. In that time, I had drawn very simple stick figures, houses, roads, lands, and many others. As I got older, I have experimented in the sketching and drawing technique during my high-school years and now expands into various works of art which includes drawings from video games, television shows, various franchises, and original content. The Orange Cat, my original character, was one of my art creations during 11th grade, and has since appeared sporadically on several occasions. There are also small instances where I have animated my drawings, but those are for small little side projects that I had in my own time.</p>

                        <p>I have an interest in making 3D models before back in my day, in the late-2000’s. I have used Dassault Systèmes’ 3DVIA Shape (formerly known as Virtual Earth 3DVIA per its partnership with Microsoft and its Virtual Earth program (now Bing Maps)) for making simple 3D models of my homes, and various other objects up until 2014 when I started to move on to making more advanced 3D models in Trimble Inc.’s Sketchup (formerly owned by Google and @Last Software) program from that year onwards. I’m also looking forward into animating 3D objects and models in the future; for a while I had Autodesk’s 3ds Max, another 3D modeling software with animation capabilities and rendering, and I’m also looking forward to other 3D modeling softwares such as Blender, Maya, etc., whenever I have the time to do so.</p>

                        <p>I’ve also had a strong interest with computers and its hardware and software inside it. In fact, I had used a computer way back when I was little, from the early-to-mid-2000’s. The first computer that me and my family had was a Compaq Presario 7000 PC that originally ran Windows Me (Millenium Edition, the last 9x-based OS from Microsoft’s Windows line of operating systems and was critically panned and hated by most users and critics alike due to its instability and rushed release) before I was born, which was presumably upgraded to the NT-based Windows XP around 2001 when it was released to the general public. With an Intel Pentium 4 processor, a Nvidia-based graphics card, a Sound Blaster-based sound card, a 320 GB hard disk drive and with 4 MB of memory, this computer served well throughout the mid-2000’s, until it was replaced with an HP Pavilion media center computer running Windows Vista from 2008 to 2012/2013. All those aside, I had an interest with computers, both old and new hardware and software.</p>

                        <p>In 2016, I started to get in a grasp with music production, using Image-Line’s FL Studio from that year to the present. Most, if not all, songs that I made in that program consists entirely of rearrangements of video game music (mostly based on rearranging music from popular video game franchises in the style of Sega’s Mega Drive/Genesis 16-bit console with FM synthesis, PSG and PCM simulation).</p>

                        <h3>Photography & Videography</h3>
                        <p>I have taken various photos and videos throughout my lifetime, starting in the mid-2000’s. My family has taken various photos and videos around the city and our house, and I started doing various videos on other random things going on in my head. Nowadays, with the advent of vlogging, I have recorded almost every single event that happened in my personal life at home and when I’m out and about to places where I want to go through photos and/or video. I had various cameras in my lifetime, for the longest time it was a Sony Cybershot camera. We had a couple of them over the years, one of them being the Cybershot P100/P150 and the Handycam DCR-DVD101 from 2004. We then had three DSC-W Cybershot cameras in the early-2010’s, a blue DSC-W, and then a both a black and red (separate cameras) DSC-W cameras. Nowadays, I’ve used my main iPhone to take pictures and videos, and records videos at 60 FPS at the highest quality setting (1080p). The skills of handling a camera and making use of every camera angle and tricks makes me a semi-expert of both photography and videography.</p>

                        <h3>Car Collection, Tuner, Car Guy & Enthusiast</h3>
                        <p>If you haven’t already guessed it by now; yes, I am also interested in cars as well! Me and my brothers have been car enthusiasts for a long time and we all have our dream cars that we want to put in our future car collection. My favorite cars are mostly on Japanese-based (<abbr title="Japanese Domestic Market">JDM</abbr>) sports cars and roadsters, with one of my favorite cars being the 1983-1987 Toyota Corolla Levin/Sprinter Trueno AE86 from Japan (known as the Toyota Corolla Sport in the USA) and the 1989-1992/1998 Nissan Silvia/180SX/240SX (S13). We’ve also made some modifications into some of our vehicles, tuning them to bring more power and output from the wheels and the powerplant, as well as aesthetic modifications for changing the looks of the car.<br><br>For those that do not know something about the two cars mentioned, let me break it down for you:<br><br>The 1983-1987 Toyota Corolla Levin/Sprinter Trueno AE86 is the sport version of the Toyota Corolla E80 series, with the “Levin” model having fixed headlights and the “Trueno” having pop-up headlamps. The AE86 came into the USA with the DX, SR-5, and GT-S trims, and all used the pop-up headlamps of the Trueno. One of the many popular paint choices for the car is a two-tone color, with one being white and black and the other in red and black. The car had a high-performance 4A-GE engine with a wide 50° valve angle, dual-overhead cams, a variable intake system named <abbr title="Toyota Variable Induction System">T-VIS</abbr>, aluminum head, cast-iron block, and rated at around 126 bhp (112 bhp for inclusion of the air-flow meter in the USA only). It also has a 5-speed manual transmission (the lower spec AE86 models also includes a 4-speed automatic). The car became popular in the drifting scene, as well as appearing in the manga and anime series, Initial D. It widely competed in Group A racing among many others. Despite the car being 37 years old and being relatively hard to find nowadays, it is still a good, fun-to-drive car in everyday driving.<br><br>The 1989-1992/1998 Nissan Silvia/180SX/240SX is based on Nissan’s now-discontinued “S” platform, specifically the S13 range. The Silvia (<abbr title="Japanese Domestic Market">JDM</abbr> only) had fixed headlights (projector lamps came as well), and the 180SX/240SX had pop-up headlamps. The car came with either the CA18DET or the SR20DET engines in Japan; the <abbr title="United States Domestic Market">USDM</abbr> market 240SX opted for the less-powerful KA24E/KA24DE engine in that region. The car became a popular drifting car, and was widely used in the drifting scene with various aftermarket parts for the S13 platform. The car is one of my favorites and was even aiming to own one and drive it one day when I’ve received it.<br><br>(Fun fact: I did see two 240SXs at my house back when my cousins used to live there, both the original and facelifted versions. The owners of the cars were just visiting though; they do not live there.)</p>
