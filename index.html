                    <p>Alright, now that you're here, let me introduce myself.<br><br>My name is Johnny Cha. I was a senior at Clovis East High School and in The Center for Advanced Research and Technology (CART), enrolled in classes that I am interested in taking. As a teenager in his age who is really into video games and in computers, I have described myself as a "tech-savvy" person that has the basic “know-how” of how these electronic devices worked, and also a “talented artist” when it comes to drawings and crafting.<br><br>In almost a few years of taking computer classes at school, I have achieved basic knowledge of programming, writing, and coding in various computer-related projects at both my middle and high schools, and at CART in my Web Applications Development class, I was taking the chance to bring my knowledge a bit further by entering the world of programming and coding with <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, and JavaScript, the three “main” parts of each and every website on the World Wide Web. In that class, I have tried my best to put in the best effort that I can to my advantage, without being distracted or side-tracked by other things. I also have to make almost everything from scratch, starting from the more simple calculator project that I had to the more intermediate and complex flexboxes and Zen Garden assignments that I had later on in the year.<br><br>If you want to learn more about myself, then click on one of the buttons below.</p>
